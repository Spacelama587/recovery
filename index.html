          fort. The
          Romans
          invaded Britain in
          43 AD.
          Around 50 AD they built a fort west of
          the River
          Derwent on the site of Belper Road. Then, about 80 AD, they built a new fort on the east bank of the
          river.
          The Romans
          called the fort Derventio. There may have been a civilian settlement outside the fort at Derby. The
          civilians could sell
          goods to the soldiers.</p>

          However, in the 4th-century Roman civilization declined. The last Roman soldiers left Britain in 407 AD.
          The

          buildings at Derby were abandoned and fell into ruins.

        <p class=" underline underline-offset-4 tracking-wide leading-loose text-2xl">There may have been a Saxon
          village on the
          site of Derby after the
          Romans left.
          However, the Danes founded
          the
          town of Derby about 873 AD after they invaded England. They created a fortified settlement at Derby. It
          was
          an
          easy place to fortify. To the east, the river Derwent protected it. To the east and south, a tributary of
          the
          Derwent protected Derby. All the Danes had to do was to fortify the northern approach between the two
          rivers. They
          dug a ditch and erected an earth bank with a wooden palisade on top. The name Derby is derived from the
          Danish
          words deor by meaning deer settlement.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="underline underline-offset-4 tracking-wide leading-loose text-2xl">In 917 the native Saxons captured
          Derby and it became part of the
          kingdom of England. Derby was more than a
          fortified settlement. Derby was also a place of trade. In the 10th century, it had a mint and a market.
          Craftsmen
          would have worked in the little town, men like blacksmiths, coopers, carpenters, and comb makers.</p>

          <div class="dot"></div>
        </div>
        <p class=" underline underline-offset-4 tracking-wide leading-loose text-2xl">By the time of the Domesday Book
          (1086) Derby had a population of
          about 2,000. That might seem very small
          to us,
          but by the standards of the time, it was a fair-sized town. (A typical village had only 100 or 150
          inhabitants).

          (a document granting the
          townspeople certain rights). In 1204 a new

          merchants of
          Derby were also allowed to form a merchantâ€™s guild. The guild regulated trade in the town and protected
          its

          Several trades were carried on in Medieval Derby. There was a wool industry. The wool was woven then
          fulled.
          This means
          it was cleaned and thickened by pounding it in a mixture of water and clay. The wool was then dyed. There
          were also many
          leather workers making gloves and saddles. There were also the same craftsmen found in any town such as
          butchers,
          bakers, brewers, carpenters, and blacksmiths.
