            Around 50 AD they built a fort west of
            the River
            Derwent on the site of Belper Road. Then, about 80 AD, they built a new fort on the east bank of the river.
            The Romans
            called the fort Derventio. There may have been a civilian settlement outside the fort at Derby. The
            civilians could sell
            goods to the soldiers.</p>

            However, in the 4th-century Roman civilization declined. The last Roman soldiers left Britain in 407 AD. The

            Romans left.
            However, the Danes founded
            the
            town of Derby about 873 AD after they invaded England. They created a fortified settlement at Derby. It was
            an
            easy place to fortify. To the east, the river Derwent protected it. To the east and south, a tributary of
            the
            Derwent protected Derby. All the Danes had to do was to fortify the northern approach between the two
            rivers. They
            dug a ditch and erected an earth bank with a wooden palisade on top. The name Derby is derived from the
            Danish
            words deor by meaning deer settlement.</p>

          <p class="underline underline-offset-4">In 917 the native Saxons captured Derby and it became part of the
            kingdom of England. Derby was more than a
            fortified settlement. Derby was also a place of trade. In the 10th century, it had a mint and a market.
            Craftsmen
            would have worked in the little town, men like blacksmiths, coopers, carpenters, and comb makers.</p>

            about 2,000. That might seem very small
            to us,
            but by the standards of the time, it was a fair-sized town. (A typical village had only 100 or 150
            inhabitants).

            Several trades were carried on in Medieval Derby. There was a wool industry. The wool was woven then fulled.
            This means
            it was cleaned and thickened by pounding it in a mixture of water and clay. The wool was then dyed. There
            were also many
            leather workers making gloves and saddles. There were also the same craftsmen found in any town such as
            butchers,
            bakers, brewers, carpenters, and blacksmiths.
